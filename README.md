This repo contains the code that is used to create my resume site [hthoma.github.io](http://hthoma.github.io). This was forked from a great project I found from the user freaksauce [here](https://github.com/freaksauce/React-Resume-ES6).  I modified it with additional components and functionality that I wanted in my website. This project utilizes a JSON resume schema, so if you like the additional functionality I provided in my project all you have to do to utilize it is edit the resume.json to fit your resume and change the ResumeDownloads.js file to your liking.
